# CRLF Injection in lumen.com
### Hi Team,
### The website located at https://lumen.com suffers from CRLF injection. 
### This allows me to inject JavaScript, HTML as well as arbitrary HTTP Headers. 
### Besides this, I can change the HTTP Response code as well, to display whatever I want in the victim's browser.


## Proof of Concept
### https://lumen.com/%0Aset-cookie:%20injected=hexygo
### The HTTP Response contains the injected Cookie!

### Finally, the setting of arbitrary Cookies also renders the Web Application to a Session Fixation vulnerability, wherein, 
### I can set an arbitrary cookie in the GET request 
### and wait for the victim to click on the link and login. 
### In this case, the cookie which I've set will then identify the victim's account. 
### Using the same cookie in my browser will authenticate the attacker to his account as well.
